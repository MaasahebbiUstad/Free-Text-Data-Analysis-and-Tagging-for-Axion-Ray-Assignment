**Project Overview**

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a dataset with free-text fields, focusing on:

- Extracting meaningful tags from textual data
- Addressing data inconsistencies
- Creating visualizations for key insights
- Summarizing actionable recommendations

**Technologies Used**

- Excel
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook


**Dataset Description**

The dataset includes:

- Text fields such as Complaint, Cause, Correction
- Reference taxonomy for predefined categories
- Numeric and categorical columns with diverse attributes
  
**Steps and Methods**

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and addressed inconsistencies.
- Column Analysis: Evaluated each column for data types, unique values, and significance.
- Feature Tagging: Extracted meaningful tags from text fields using keyword matching and regex.
- Visualization: Created plots (e.g., histograms, bar charts) to highlight critical insights.
- Summary: Generated recommendations and identified trends in the data.


**Results and Insights**

- Summarized key failure conditions and components from free-text fields.
- Identified top critical columns for stakeholders.
- Provided actionable recommendations based on the dataset.
